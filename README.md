Plant image identification has become an interdisciplinary focus in both botanical taxonomy and computer vision. A model was made for the identification of species with a final loss value of 0.5893 and precision of 0.9893, in which 15 species belonging to the Bogot√° urban trees are contemplated. For the creation of the dataset, a character was selected for each of the species (flower, fruit, wood, leaf, height).
